## Ruby Release

To vendor ruby package into your release, run:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/bosh-packages/ruby-release
$ cd ~/workspace/your-release
$ bosh vendor-package <%= ruby_packagename %> ~/workspace/ruby-release
```

The above code will add `<%= ruby_packagename %>` to `your-release` and introduce a `spec.lock`.

Included packages:

- <%= ruby_packagename %> which includes:
  - ruby-<%= ruby_version %>
  - yaml-<%= yaml_version %>
  - rubygems-<%= rubygems_version %>

Included functions in `compile.env`:

- `bosh_bundle` which runs `bundle install ...` targeted at `${BOSH_INSTALL_TARGET}`
- `bosh_generate_runtime_env` which generates `${BOSH_INSTALL_TARGET}/bosh/runtime.env`

To use `ruby-*` package for compilation in your packaging script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash -eu
source /var/vcap/packages/<%= ruby_packagename %>/bosh/compile.env
...
bosh_bundle
bosh_generate_runtime_env
```

To use `ruby-*` package at runtime in your job scripts:

```bash
#!/bin/bash -eu
source /var/vcap/packages/<%= ruby_packagename %>/bosh/runtime.env
source /var/vcap/packages/your-package/bosh/runtime.env
bundle exec ...
```

See [packages/<%= test_packagename %>](packages/<%= test_packagename %>) and [jobs/<%= test_jobname %>](jobs/<%= test_jobname %>) for example.
